This is a document of TODO items that we are currently leaving behind, and may come back to later.


1)
#this doesnt work: cant handle : 2*x(1) + x(2) >= 14
string = """
cvx_begin
variables x(2)
minimize 2*x(1) + 4*x(2)
2*x(1) + x(2) >= 14
x(1) + x(2) >= 12
x(1) + 3*x(2) >= 18
x(1) >= 0
x(2) >= 0
cvx_end
"""



2)
Add checks for variable dimension. if x(3) is declared, x(>3) should not be accessed


3) implement __add__ instead of posy_add_posy()

4) add dual variables in GP

5) mono == mono == mono == mono is also possible. implement that ?

6) chained constraints in GP
