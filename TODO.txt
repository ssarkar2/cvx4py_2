This is a document of TODO items that we are currently leaving behind, and may come back to later.

SOCP
1)
#this doesnt work: cant handle : 2*x(1) + x(2) >= 14
string = """
cvx_begin
variables x(2)
minimize 2*x(1) + 4*x(2)
2*x(1) + x(2) >= 14
x(1) + x(2) >= 12
x(1) + 3*x(2) >= 18
x(1) >= 0
x(2) >= 0
cvx_end
"""

2) dual variable like this: x > 1 : dx, instead of dx : x > 1


GP
1) there is an extra print 'ggg' in gp path. find and delete it

2) DONE: Add checks for variable dimension. if x(3) is declared, x(>3) should not be accessed

3) implement __add__ instead of posy_add_posy()

4) add dual variables in GP

5) mono == mono == mono == mono is also possible. implement that ?

6) chained constraints in GP

7)feasibility problem (if no objective or constant objecive)

8) support ineqs/eqs of this type: x >= 1 (where x is a vector)
support sliced variables. x(2:3) >= 1
